# Satu - HTML & CSS (satu.josuamanullang.com)

### Intro

This website was created to sharpen basic skills and knowledge such as how a
page works on a web. Through this web, I can master many things, starting from
the process of how a website will be displayed until it can be accessed directly
through a browser.

Also this website is a side project. There are many things that I can develop
and make better after this.
